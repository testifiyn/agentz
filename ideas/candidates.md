# Candidate ideas

## Round 1 (2026-09-19, post-reset)

Three parallel discovery agents researched micro-SaaS ops tools,
directory/comparison sites, and browser extensions, each required to
check "is this already captured?" before writing anything up. **Result:
zero strong survivors across all three niches.** This is itself the
important finding of this round — recorded in full below and in
`MEMORY.md`, not discarded.

### Micro-SaaS agent: 0 strong / 1 weak survivor, 8 discarded

Discarded as already well-served: invoice/payment chasing (crowded with
Gumroad micro-tools + AND.CO/Fiverr Workspace), client feedback/proofing
(10+ active competitors with free tiers), proposal software (crowded
under PandaDoc/Proposify), Google review reply management (weak demand —
the bottleneck is asking for reviews, not replying), WordPress
maintenance reports (MainWP free/self-hosted + WP Client Reports free
plugin already do this), appointment no-show SMS/WhatsApp reminders (real
gap in Calendly's free tier, but already filled by Remindlo/GReminders/
WhatSawa, and WhatsApp's Cloud API now bills business-initiated reminder
messages — not €0-buildable at scale anyway), Upwork/Fiverr client scam
vetting (GetMany already does this), EU freelancer VAT/reverse-charge
invoicing (Xolo/Quaderno+Wise already serve it), client intake forms
(Tally already offers a genuinely free unlimited tier, closing the
Typeform-price complaint).

**Weak survivor — change-order/scope-creep formalization tool.** Real
pain (Ignition's research: >$76k/year in unrecovered out-of-scope work
for accounting firms; 43% of accounting pros just absorb it) and real
willingness-to-pay signals (several Gumroad "scope creep kit" products
exist). But existing competitors bundle this into $17-52/mo full CRMs
(Bonsai/HoneyBook/Dubsado) or price it at accounting firms specifically
(Ignition), and the agent's own honest assessment: "it's a thin wedge —
the actual product (a form + PDF + e-sign) is trivial to replicate... I'd
rate this candidate marginal, not a clear win."

### Directory/comparison agent: 0 strong / 1 marginal survivor, 8 discarded

Discarded as already saturated (all with active, 2026-dated competitors):
appliance error-code lookup (8+ sites), foreign degree recognition in
Germany (official free anabin/ZAB database), Bavarian-formula GPA→German
grade converter (6+ free calculators), German driving-license conversion
(ADAC + others maintain live 2026-updated lists), UK/Ireland product
recall checker (official gov.uk + CCPC.ie tools plus recallscope.com),
German health-insurance osteopathy reimbursement comparison (8+ dedicated
sites — "exactly the kind of niche the SEO/affiliate industry has mined
hardest"), German municipal business-tax rate (Gewerbesteuer/
Grundsteuer-Hebesatz) lookup (full-coverage tools + an official
government map already exist), UK campervan-conversion insurance
comparison (Quotezone + specialist insurers already active).

**Marginal survivor — UK "XL Bully"/banned-breed dog insurance &
compliance tracker.** Real, well-evidenced acute gap: Dogs Trust (the
only affordable insurer at £25/yr) is stopping this cover from 1 July
2026, leaving owners quoted premiums "potentially exceeding £900/year"
(multiple 2026 trade-press sources), and no neutral comparison site was
found. **But the discovery agent itself flagged a fatal timing problem:**
the UK government removed the mandatory insurance *requirement* for
exempted dogs on 1 July 2026 — the same date Dogs Trust stopped
coverage — so by today (19 Sept 2026) the acute forced-purchase urgency
has already passed, shrinking this from "urgent mandatory purchase" to
"softer voluntary/health-insurance shopping problem." A first-mover
competitor (napo.pet) already has an SEO-capture landing page. Small
finite population (~50k exemption certificates) regardless.

### Browser-extension agent: 0 clean survivors, 2 marginal near-misses, 12 discarded

Discarded as saturated with active, well-rated 2026 competitors: Gmail
bulk unsubscribe, hide YouTube Shorts, ChatGPT→Markdown export, YouTube
transcript copy, Amazon sponsored-listing blocker, recipe "jump to
recipe" filter, hide Google AI Overviews, cookie-consent auto-reject
(Consent-O-Matic), ghost-job/expired-listing detector (also needs a
crowdsourced backend, violating the €0/client-only constraint),
Facebook Marketplace scam detector (7+ competitors).

**Important new structural finding — the fake-review-checker space
(Fakespot's July 2025 shutdown) has now spawned at least 8 near-identical
new entrants** (ReviewShield, Null Fake, LocalVerdict, ReviewLens,
RatingVerifier, Amazon Fake Review Analyzer, Overprice, RealReviews.io),
most with tiny user counts (2-50) and template-mill naming — direct,
current confirmation of the "single dated event visible to every builder
at once" trap.

**Marginal near-miss 1 — Airbnb "true total price" corrector.** Real
documented bug reports on the one existing competitor (NaN prices,
inconsistent coverage), but Airbnb itself rolled out default total-price
display in 2025 to comply with the FTC's junk-fee rule — the platform is
solving its own underlying problem, shrinking the addressable pain
forward, plus inherently small single-site TAM.

**Marginal near-miss 2 — LinkedIn feed/promoted-post decluttering.**
Genuinely fragmented quality at the bottom of the market (several 2-3★
options with DOM-selector-churn complaints), but at least one competitor
("LinkedIn Content Hider") is already reported at 4.8-5.0★ and
privacy-clean — not actually uncaptured, just messy.

**Methodology note:** this agent's Chrome Web Store access was blocked by
an egress proxy restriction, so store ratings/counts came from
search-snippet summaries rather than direct page reads and gave
inconsistent numbers in two cases — treat exact figures as directional.
A real validation pass on anything from this agent should re-verify via
a different access route before relying on precise numbers.

All three agents converged independently on the same conclusion: the
"brainstorm an obvious consumer/freelancer pain point, then check if it's
taken" methodology is now producing systematically weak results, even
across genuinely different niches (general freelancer ops, DE/UK
consumer directories, mainstream-platform browser utilities).

## Round 2 (same day) — three redirected strategies

### Non-English vertical B2B (regulated professions): 0 survivors

Tested 7 profession×country pairs (Polish sworn translators, Czech court
interpreters, Czech court experts, Spanish property managers, Polish
driving instructors, Portuguese solicitadores, Dutch bailiffs) with
in-language searches. **Every one already has either an official
free tool from the profession's own regulator/chamber, a free grassroots
tool built by a peer practitioner, or a mature commercial vertical SaaS
serving it at low per-seat pricing.** Meta-finding: regulated professions
with real compliance pain are exactly the populations motivated enough to
already have built or bought a fix — regulation itself creates the
incentive for someone (often the regulator) to close the gap fast.

### Very recent (<4mo) trigger events: 0 strong survivors, 1 marginal

Tested 4 genuinely recent 2026 triggers (GitHub Copilot metered billing,
June 2026; Notion Mail shutdown, announced June 2026, dead Sept 22 2026;
PromptPerfect shutdown, Sept 2026; OpenAI Assistants API deprecation,
Aug 26 2026). **All saturated within 2-12 weeks of the trigger date** —
PromptPerfect fastest at ~2-3 weeks (9 near-identical "alternative"
wrapper sites already live), Copilot billing at ~10 weeks (7+ trackers
plus GitHub's own native dashboard), Notion Mail at ~12 weeks (7+
listicles plus a repositioned incumbent). **Key finding: recency no
longer buys head start once a trigger is newsworthy/SEO-indexed — any
"X is shutting down 2026" query already returns a content farm within
weeks.** Marginal survivor: a free offline codemod CLI for OpenAI
Assistants-API migration (no official migration tool exists, and the
shim/proxy angle is taken but a pure static-analysis codemod isn't) — but
the best-fit audience already hit the wall ~3 weeks before this research,
leaving only a shrinking laggard pool, and monetization is thin (GitHub
Sponsors / lead-gen at best). Not picked.

### Maintenance-labor-moat niches: 1 real survivor, 1 conditional, 2 rejected

Rejected: "best VPN for China" live-status tracker (real staleness
problem, but already dominated by well-funded affiliate publishers —
Gizmodo, TechRadar, CyberInsider — running continuous test panels a solo
€0 builder can't out-resource); ad-blocker/Manifest-V3 compatibility
tracker (real staleness during Chrome's MV3 rollout, but by Sept 2026
this is a settled fact pattern, not fast-changing enough to sustain a
moat). Conditional, not picked: developer "free tier" status tracker
(real staleness evidence — outdated "free cloud hosting" listicles still
describe AWS's pre-July-2025 tier — but an existing resource, Hatchable,
already does this well and is current; would need a narrower wedge like
free-tier LLM API credits specifically).

**Survivor — "Living" Digital Nomad Visa Status Tracker — ★ AGENT_PICK
for full adversarial validation.** Real, well-evidenced staleness problem:
visa income thresholds are pegged to annually-revised local wage indices,
so published figures go stale within a year; whole programs quietly die
with no press release (Antigua & Barbuda's Nomad Digital Residence shut
Nov 2025; Anguilla's official page "gone quiet... untouched for years";
the Bahamas program "seemingly discontinued") yet still appear on
aggregator lists. Nomad List itself draws documented complaints about
outdated/inaccurate crowd-sourced data. MVP: static site with a
version-controlled dataset, visible "last verified" date per country, and
a free GitHub Actions change-detector polling official government source
URLs weekly to flag updates for manual review (~3-5 hrs/week estimated
maintenance labor). Monetization: SafetyWing/Genki nomad-insurance
affiliate links, relocation-consultant referral fees, eventual "verified
visa alert" newsletter. The research agent itself flagged the moat as
"weak but real — not technical, behavioral": nothing stops another
AI-agent builder from cloning the same playbook, the edge is that
existing incumbents in this space are annual-refresh SEO content mills,
not continuous primary-source monitors.

**Important validation flag (from this project's own institutional
memory, not from this research agent):** the general digital-nomad-visa-
comparison concept was examined once before in this project's history —
a now-deleted prior run found several close competitors (WhereToNomad,
GlobalNomad.guide, and others) already running matching-by-income/tax/
lifestyle filter tools. This round's proposed differentiator is
different (a *living*, continuously-re-verified resource with visible
"last verified" dates, not a matching filter), but the adversarial
validation pass on this candidate MUST specifically re-check whether
those or other incumbents already do continuous/dated freshness
verification — if they do, the core differentiator collapses the same
way it did for this project's previously-validated "automatic AI-slop
detection" candidate, where the wedge looked open until a dedicated
competitor re-check found it already filled.

Proceeding to VALIDATING — see `research/nomad-visa-tracker.md`.

## STATUS UPDATE: nomad-visa-tracker KILLED — confirms the flagged risk

Adversarial validation confirmed the exact concern raised above: at least
six named competitors (Discovery Sessions, NomadQualify, WhereNext,
VisaDB.io, Enomads, Immigrant Invest/Passportivity) already display
visible "last verified/updated" dates, one just two days more recent than
this validation itself. The core differentiator ("existing resources are
static, ours is visibly current") is factually false as a market
description. Full report: `research/nomad-visa-tracker.md`. **This is the
second time in this project's history a "incumbents are static, we'll be
dynamic" wedge looked open at discovery time and collapsed under
dedicated adversarial re-check** (the first was the AI-slop search
filter, in now-deleted history) — worth treating as a standing pattern.

**All candidates from both Round 1 and Round 2 are now dead.** Ten
distinct redirected strategies have now been tried in this single day
(post-reset): general micro-SaaS, DE/UK evergreen comparisons, mainstream
browser extensions, non-English vertical B2B professions, very-recent
(<4mo) trigger events, and maintenance-labor-moat niches. None produced a
survivor that held up under dedicated adversarial validation. See
`MEMORY.md` for the full status and the Round 3 redirection (combining
two specific suggestions from Round 2's own research agents: a narrow
cross-profession utility tied to a <12-month regulatory/technical change
that requires genuine engineering effort to address, not a thin wrapper —
targeting the gap between "too recent to be cloned yet" and "requires
real work, so clones are slower").

## Round 3 — engineering-effort-moat regulatory niches: 0 survivors

Tested 4 candidates tied to recent (within ~12 months) regulatory/
technical changes requiring genuinely nontrivial engineering, not a thin
wrapper:

1. **EU Cyber Resilience Act vulnerability reporting** (live 11 Sept
   2026) — real engineering complexity (SBOM parsing, OSV/CISA-KEV
   matching, Art.14 report generation), but **7+ GitHub repos already
   shipped compliance tools within ~8 days of the deadline** — the clone
   wave adapted to "hard" engineering, just taking ~1 week instead of
   2-3.
2. **EUDR geolocation/due-diligence for micro importers** — real
   complexity (GeoJSON/KML parsing, deforestation-raster overlay), killed
   three ways at once: a free complete toolkit already exists (Preferred
   by Nature), a free no-signup validator already exists (Silvatrace),
   and a regulatory simplification just let the smallest operators skip
   geolocation data entirely, removing the exact complexity a tool would
   monetize.
3. **DAC8/CARF crypto-asset tax reporting** (in force 1 Jan 2026) — the
   one candidate with a plausible residual competitive gap (existing
   vendors are enterprise-tiered), but rejected on trust/market-size
   grounds: regulated financial entities won't file tax reports through
   an unaccountable solo/AI-built tool, and the addressable market
   (~300 MiCA-licensed firms post-consolidation) is too thin for €0
   organic distribution.
4. **EU PPWR recyclability grading / UK packaging EPR fees** — dead on
   both counts: the EU methodology isn't even defined yet (deferred to
   2028), and the UK version was saturated by multiple calculators the
   moment its fee schedule published.

**Verdict: 0 survivors, and a sharper version of the standing lesson.**
Engineering complexity does not buy meaningfully more runway than a thin
wrapper does — it only shifted the clone-saturation window from ~2-3
weeks to ~1-2 weeks in the one case with real complexity (CRA). The
research agent's own conclusion: "complexity seems to only shift the
clone-saturation window... not to months." Recommends the next search
either target changes too obscure to be publicly countdown-clocked (no
swarm trigger), or abandon the regulatory-trigger axis entirely.

## Summary: 11 discovery strategies tried in one day, zero survivors

Round 1 (3 strategies) + Round 2 (3 strategies) + Round 3 (1 strategy,
4 sub-candidates) + the original Run 1-3 history before today's reset
(6 more strategies, now deleted but summarized in `MEMORY.md`) = 11
distinct angles tried today alone, all killed either at discovery-stage
screening or at dedicated adversarial validation. See `MEMORY.md` for the
full structural read and recommended next steps for the owner's
attention.

## Round 4 (2026-10-01) — testing the two levers Round 1-3 flagged as untested

Twelve days after Round 3, this run deliberately tested the two specific
untested levers `MEMORY.md` had flagged for "next time": (1) react to
triggers within 24-72h of breaking, before SEO-indexing/cloning, and (2) a
non-software business model (content/service) where the moat isn't "built
it first." A fourth, confirmatory strategy (fresh community-pain scanning)
ran in parallel. Four agents in total; all four strategies again produced
zero surviving candidates, but with a materially different and more
useful kind of result than Round 1-3's "already captured" pattern.

### Strategy A — 24-72h-fresh trigger scan: 0 survivors, methodology itself disproven

Checked 7 candidate triggers genuinely active in the exact Sept 28-Oct 1
window (Apple's EU commission restructuring effective literally Oct 1;
Gemini 2.0 Flash deprecation; OpenAI Sora 2 API shutdown; Chrome MV2
removal; the chalk/debug/ansi-styles npm supply-chain attack; WordPress
plugin CVEs; several smaller leads). Every one that looked genuinely fresh
turned out, on inspection, to have had weeks of advance notice (Apple's
change was announced Aug 18, six weeks early) or to already be covered
within hours by existing always-on monitoring infrastructure (security
vendors like Aikido/Socket.dev, SEO trackers like MozCast, official
vendor-published calculators). **Meta-finding, more important than any
single kill:** generic web search has an effective indexing/aggregation
lag of roughly 1-4 weeks for "recent" queries, so by the time an event is
findable via the same search tooling a competitor would use, it has
already been covered. The "literally last 24-72 hours" lever is real in
principle but cannot be executed via periodic manual search sessions — it
would require standing infrastructure (RSS/changelog/status-page polling
running continuously), which a once-a-day agent run doing point-in-time
search cannot outpace. This lever is not "tried and failed," it's "the
wrong tool for this lever" — see `MEMORY.md` for the resulting
recommendation.

### Strategy B — fresh community-pain scan (confirmatory): 0 verifiable survivors

Checked 9 candidate pain points from the same window (iOS 26 battery
drain, TikTok Shop US policy changes, Amazon Price History expansion,
Global Payments' new merchant fee, Etsy/LinkedIn/YouTube creator-policy
backlash, a Google ranking-volatility event, Chrome MV2, two AI-tool
quality complaints). All were either already covered by existing
vendors/consultants, too evergreen to count as a fresh spike, or not
shaped as a product a solo €0 builder could serve. **Important caveat the
agent itself flagged:** this session's egress proxy blocks direct fetches
to reddit.com, news.ycombinator.com, and hn.algolia.com, so the scan relied
on search-engine-indexed secondary coverage of forum sentiment rather than
live raw threads — a real blind spot. Treat this result as "nothing
verifiable," not "proven empty." Worth asking the owner whether direct
network access to these specific sources could be enabled, since the
project's own standing recommendation (test fresh community pain) is
exactly what this limitation degrades.

### Strategy C — content/service business model test: 1 candidate found, killed on dedicated adversarial pass

Identified "buy-side due-diligence service for micro-acquisitions"
($300-900 flat-fee human-verified reports for buyers of sub-$150k online
businesses on Flippa/Acquire.com-style marketplaces) as a structurally
different kind of candidate — the first non-software, trust-moat-based
idea this project has tested. A dedicated adversarial validation pass
(Strategy D, run immediately after) killed it: the claimed price gap
between $199 generic checks and $1M+ enterprise firms doesn't exist —
it's populated at $297 (automated/ProofCap), $500-2,500
(Flippa/Acquire.com's own native, partly-free due-diligence features),
$1,900-2,900 (WebAcquisition, a branded specialist with a founder's public
200+-deal track record), and $3k-5k (DueDilio). A live Indie Hackers
competitor is already building the identical concept. Full validation:
`research/micro-acquisition-due-diligence.md`. A second candidate
(small-importer tariff/HTS classification advisory) was rejected by the
discovery agent itself before validation, for requiring trade-compliance
expertise the operator doesn't have.

### The sharper structural finding from Round 4

Every one of the 12 candidates now killed across this project's history
(11 software + this 1 service) fails for variants of the same root cause:
**a generic, identity-less, audience-less €0-capital AI agent starting
from nothing has no way to manufacture a trust or speed advantage that an
equally-resourced competitor, or the platform/incumbent itself, cannot
match or beat.** Software candidates lost the speed race because
competitors have the same AI tooling. The one service candidate tested
lost the trust race because every surviving competitor had a named
founder's public track record, a vetted-marketplace brand, or
platform-native distribution — assets this project's starting position
cannot create from scratch, only receive from the owner (an existing
skill, audience, domain expertise, or network) or build slowly over
months. See `MEMORY.md` for the recommendation this produces.
