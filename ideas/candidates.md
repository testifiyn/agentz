# Candidate ideas

## Round 1 (2026-09-19, post-reset)

Three parallel discovery agents researched micro-SaaS ops tools,
directory/comparison sites, and browser extensions, each required to
check "is this already captured?" before writing anything up. **Result:
zero strong survivors across all three niches.** This is itself the
important finding of this round — recorded in full below and in
`MEMORY.md`, not discarded.

### Micro-SaaS agent: 0 strong / 1 weak survivor, 8 discarded

Discarded as already well-served: invoice/payment chasing (crowded with
Gumroad micro-tools + AND.CO/Fiverr Workspace), client feedback/proofing
(10+ active competitors with free tiers), proposal software (crowded
under PandaDoc/Proposify), Google review reply management (weak demand —
the bottleneck is asking for reviews, not replying), WordPress
maintenance reports (MainWP free/self-hosted + WP Client Reports free
plugin already do this), appointment no-show SMS/WhatsApp reminders (real
gap in Calendly's free tier, but already filled by Remindlo/GReminders/
WhatSawa, and WhatsApp's Cloud API now bills business-initiated reminder
messages — not €0-buildable at scale anyway), Upwork/Fiverr client scam
vetting (GetMany already does this), EU freelancer VAT/reverse-charge
invoicing (Xolo/Quaderno+Wise already serve it), client intake forms
(Tally already offers a genuinely free unlimited tier, closing the
Typeform-price complaint).

**Weak survivor — change-order/scope-creep formalization tool.** Real
pain (Ignition's research: >$76k/year in unrecovered out-of-scope work
for accounting firms; 43% of accounting pros just absorb it) and real
willingness-to-pay signals (several Gumroad "scope creep kit" products
exist). But existing competitors bundle this into $17-52/mo full CRMs
(Bonsai/HoneyBook/Dubsado) or price it at accounting firms specifically
(Ignition), and the agent's own honest assessment: "it's a thin wedge —
the actual product (a form + PDF + e-sign) is trivial to replicate... I'd
rate this candidate marginal, not a clear win."

### Directory/comparison agent: 0 strong / 1 marginal survivor, 8 discarded

Discarded as already saturated (all with active, 2026-dated competitors):
appliance error-code lookup (8+ sites), foreign degree recognition in
Germany (official free anabin/ZAB database), Bavarian-formula GPA→German
grade converter (6+ free calculators), German driving-license conversion
(ADAC + others maintain live 2026-updated lists), UK/Ireland product
recall checker (official gov.uk + CCPC.ie tools plus recallscope.com),
German health-insurance osteopathy reimbursement comparison (8+ dedicated
sites — "exactly the kind of niche the SEO/affiliate industry has mined
hardest"), German municipal business-tax rate (Gewerbesteuer/
Grundsteuer-Hebesatz) lookup (full-coverage tools + an official
government map already exist), UK campervan-conversion insurance
comparison (Quotezone + specialist insurers already active).

**Marginal survivor — UK "XL Bully"/banned-breed dog insurance &
compliance tracker.** Real, well-evidenced acute gap: Dogs Trust (the
only affordable insurer at £25/yr) is stopping this cover from 1 July
2026, leaving owners quoted premiums "potentially exceeding £900/year"
(multiple 2026 trade-press sources), and no neutral comparison site was
found. **But the discovery agent itself flagged a fatal timing problem:**
the UK government removed the mandatory insurance *requirement* for
exempted dogs on 1 July 2026 — the same date Dogs Trust stopped
coverage — so by today (19 Sept 2026) the acute forced-purchase urgency
has already passed, shrinking this from "urgent mandatory purchase" to
"softer voluntary/health-insurance shopping problem." A first-mover
competitor (napo.pet) already has an SEO-capture landing page. Small
finite population (~50k exemption certificates) regardless.

### Browser-extension agent: 0 clean survivors, 2 marginal near-misses, 12 discarded

Discarded as saturated with active, well-rated 2026 competitors: Gmail
bulk unsubscribe, hide YouTube Shorts, ChatGPT→Markdown export, YouTube
transcript copy, Amazon sponsored-listing blocker, recipe "jump to
recipe" filter, hide Google AI Overviews, cookie-consent auto-reject
(Consent-O-Matic), ghost-job/expired-listing detector (also needs a
crowdsourced backend, violating the €0/client-only constraint),
Facebook Marketplace scam detector (7+ competitors).

**Important new structural finding — the fake-review-checker space
(Fakespot's July 2025 shutdown) has now spawned at least 8 near-identical
new entrants** (ReviewShield, Null Fake, LocalVerdict, ReviewLens,
RatingVerifier, Amazon Fake Review Analyzer, Overprice, RealReviews.io),
most with tiny user counts (2-50) and template-mill naming — direct,
current confirmation of the "single dated event visible to every builder
at once" trap.

**Marginal near-miss 1 — Airbnb "true total price" corrector.** Real
documented bug reports on the one existing competitor (NaN prices,
inconsistent coverage), but Airbnb itself rolled out default total-price
display in 2025 to comply with the FTC's junk-fee rule — the platform is
solving its own underlying problem, shrinking the addressable pain
forward, plus inherently small single-site TAM.

**Marginal near-miss 2 — LinkedIn feed/promoted-post decluttering.**
Genuinely fragmented quality at the bottom of the market (several 2-3★
options with DOM-selector-churn complaints), but at least one competitor
("LinkedIn Content Hider") is already reported at 4.8-5.0★ and
privacy-clean — not actually uncaptured, just messy.

**Methodology note:** this agent's Chrome Web Store access was blocked by
an egress proxy restriction, so store ratings/counts came from
search-snippet summaries rather than direct page reads and gave
inconsistent numbers in two cases — treat exact figures as directional.
A real validation pass on anything from this agent should re-verify via
a different access route before relying on precise numbers.

## AGENT_PICK: none — no candidate from Round 1 clears the bar

All three agents converged independently on the same conclusion: the
"brainstorm an obvious consumer/freelancer pain point, then check if it's
taken" methodology is now producing systematically weak results, even
across genuinely different niches (general freelancer ops, DE/UK
consumer directories, mainstream-platform browser utilities). See
`MEMORY.md` for the full reasoning and the redirected strategy for the
next discovery round (already in progress in this same run — non-English
vertical professional niches, very recent post-event gaps under 12 months
old, and niches with a real ongoing-maintenance-labor moat).
